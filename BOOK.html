Those wanting to take a hard pass on Knuth's brilliant but impenetrable theories, and the dense multi-page proofs found in most textbooks, will want to read Grokking Algorithms. This fully-illustrated and engaging guide makes it easy to learn how to use algorithms effectively. Grokking Algorithms is a disarming take on a core computer science topic and shows readers how to apply common algorithms to practical problems faced in the day-to-day life of a programmer. It starts with problems like sorting and searching and builds up skills in thinking algorithmically.</span></p><button class="btn btn-primary" type="button"><a href="https://www.pdfdrive.com/download.pdf?id=105413330&amp;h=62bcc8692bf5a8956e02e5dcb1f368ab&amp;u=cache&amp;ext=pdf"><span style="color: rgb(232, 235, 238);">Read More</span></a></button>

                                <h3><strong>Python 3 Object-Oriented Programming - Third Edition</strong></h3>
                                <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a popular design paradigm in which data and behaviors are encapsulated in such a way that they can be manipulated together. This third edition of Python 3 Object-Oriented Programming fully explains classes, data encapsulation, and exceptions with an emphasis on when you can use each principle to develop well-designed software.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Starting with a detailed analysis of object-oriented programming, you will use the Python programming language to clearly grasp key concepts from the object-oriented paradigm. You will learn how to create maintainable applications by studying higher level design patterns. The book will show you the complexities of string and file manipulation, and how Python distinguishes between binary and textual data. Not one, but two very powerful automated testing systems, unittest and pytest, will be introduced in this book. You'll get a comprehensive introduction to Python's concurrent programming ecosystem.</p><button class="btn btn-primary" type="button"><a href="DBMSQ.html"><span style="color: rgb(232, 235, 238);">Read More</span></a></button>

But to truly master Linux, you need to understand its internals, like how the system boots, how networking works, and what the kernel actually does.In this completely revised second edition of the perennial best seller How Linux Works, author Brian Ward makes the concepts behind Linux internals accessible to anyone curious about the inner workings of the operating system. Inside, youâ€™ll find the kind of knowledge that normally comes from years of experience doing things the hard way. Youâ€™ll learn:â€“How Linux boots, from boot loaders to init implementations (systemd, Upstart, and System V)â€“How the kernel manages devices, device drivers, and processesâ€“How networking, interfaces, firewalls, and servers workâ€“How development tools work and relate to shared librariesâ€“How to write effective shell scriptsYouâ€™ll also explore the kernel and examine key system tasks inside user space, including system calls, input and output, and filesystems.</span></p><button class="btn btn-primary" type="button"><a href="https://www.pdfdrive.com/download.pdf?id=33595259&amp;h=ee21b4b4a881bb55f414ad49796dd134&amp;u=cache&amp;ext=pdf"><span style="color: rgb(232, 235, 238);">Read More</span></a></button>

                                <p>Kubernetes is the operating system of the cloud native world,&nbsp;providing a reliable and scalable platform for running containerized&nbsp;workloads. In this friendly, pragmatic book, cloud experts John Arundel&nbsp;and Justin Domingus show you what Kubernetes can doâ€”and what you can do&nbsp;with it.Youâ€™ll learn all about the Kubernetes ecosystem, and use&nbsp;battle-tested solutions to everyday problems. Youâ€™ll build, step by <br>step, an example cloud native application and its supporting&nbsp;infrastructure, along with a development environment and continuous&nbsp;deployment pipeline that you can use for your own applications.</p><button class="btn btn-primary" type="button"><a href="https://www.pdfdrive.com/download.pdf?id=187562166&amp;h=899d6a6976affcc6de962d140350436b&amp;u=cache&amp;ext=pdf"><span style="color: rgb(232, 235, 238);">Read More</span></a></button>

But like all good things, they come with their own set of&nbsp;challenges. This is where Kubernetes enters the scene.<br>Kubernetes&nbsp;helps you deploy and manage containerized applications at scale. It <br>abstracts the underlying infrastructure so that you don't need to care&nbsp;whether you're deploying your applications to Amazon Web Services,&nbsp;Microsoft Azure, or your own on-premises datacenter. With Kubernetes,&nbsp;you can develop your applications on your laptop, deploy to your chosen&nbsp;cloud platform, migrate to a different cloud platform, and even migrate&nbsp;to your private cloud at your on-premises datacenter.</p><button class="btn btn-primary" type="button"><a href="OPERATING%20SYSTEMQ.html"><span style="color: rgb(232, 235, 238);">Read More</span></a></button>

And yet, high performers using DevOps principles,&nbsp;such as Google, Amazon, Facebook, Etsy, and Netflix, are routinely&nbsp;deploying code into production hundreds, or even thousands, of times per&nbsp;day, while providing world-class agility, reliability, and security.
